### Joni Mitchell - Favorite Colour
I met a child a year ago
Whose eyes would never see.
She asked me with a timid smile,
"What colour is a tree?"

"In summertime a tree is green;
In autumn gold and red;
In winter they are frosted white
when all their leaves are shed."

"I know the sky is blue," she said.
"And silver is the sand;
And apples are the brightest red.
What colour is a man?"

"Man is many colours child:
Some are yellow, some are brown.
And some are black as sightlessness,
Some white as eiderdown."

She took her crayons from a box
And placed them in my glove
And said, "By mixing all of these
Comes my favourite colour--love."

## How we will implement Separation of Concerns and BEM
Separation of concerns is helping to focus on one aspect of a problem at a time, and usually consists of different technologies for each of the concerns. For our project we will be using HTML, CSS and SCSS. Our styling will be separated into different categories to separate them, and make it easier to do changes and have control. Two of the subcategories we will include will at least be colours and typography in one way or another. 

BEM stands for «Block element modifier» and is a naming convention used in development for making the code easier to read and understand. It is the naming convention standard that we will be using for our project to keep our CSS understandable.
